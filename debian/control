Description: Network neighbor monitoring daemon
 Passively watches ARP and NDP traffic on all Ethernet interfaces, records
 IP-to-MAC mappings, and alerts you when something changes. Like arpwatch,
 but also handles IPv6 and runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.
 Single-threaded, single binary, no dependencies beyond libpcap.
